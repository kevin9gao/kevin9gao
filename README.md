# Hey! I'm Kevin Gao.

I'm a full stack software engineer based in San Francisco, California, who loves writing beautiful and efficient code to solve complex problems. I went to college and obtained a Bachelor's in Physiology & Neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego, but after a major car accident in 2017 that left me with a traumatic brain injury, I decided I didn't want to continue pursuing medicine and instead pivoted my career focus into software engineering. 

### I graduated from App Academy Software Engineering Bootcamp in 2022 after half a year of diving head first into coding.

Through the program, I re-discovered my love for coding that I was first exposed to briefly in high school. I worked with languages like JavaScript & Python and frameworks such as React, Redux, Express, and SQLAlchemy. 

### Some things about me:

- I love all things EDM music and DJ in my spare time as a hobby. I love making mixes because I like to listen back to my favorite songs with awesome transitions between them.
- I'm very active in the gym and go regularly - three to five times a week!
- I have two pets - a cat, Ahri (American Shorthair munchkin), and a dog, Dindin (Shih Tzu/Toy Poodle). I love them both very much!

## Currently looking for employment in San Francisco or surrounding areas!
